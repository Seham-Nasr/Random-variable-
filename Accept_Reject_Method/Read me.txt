The code programmed using Python language  3.7 , Juypter editor 

compile and run
1- the libraries imported are numpy, math and some case I used random lib and for plot the graphs I used the library     matplotlib.pyplot as plt and Finally I used  scipy.integrate import quad library to calculate the Area under the curve     which should be =1

2- I used 1000000 samples to generate Random variable. I also tried different number of samples while I was coding
3- the function "numpy.random.uniform(0,1)" used to generate the uniform r.v in range 0,1

To compile and run the code :
 the code can be opened using windows notepad or any python editor
 you can run the code using online python editor, but first you must download the required libraries
