The code programmed using Python language  3.7 , Spyder editor 

compile and run
1- the libraries imported are numpy, math and some case I used random lib
2- the user must insert the N value which determine the how many r.v that system should generated
3- the function "numpy.random.uniform(0,1,n)" used to generate the uniform r.v in range 0,1
4- to generate uniform r.v (-5,100), use uniform function (x-a)/(b-a)
5- Exponential with mean =100, I used the formula o exp. function then got the inverse function of it with lembda = 1/100
   I used loop to include all generated r.v then print the result.

the code can be opened using windows notepad or any python editor
